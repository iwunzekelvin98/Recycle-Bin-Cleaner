Identify the Recycle Bin Location:
Understand where the recycle bin is located on the system. On Windows, it's typically in a directory like $Recycle.Bin. On other systems, it might be in a different location.

List Files in the Recycle Bin:
Use fs.readdirSync() to get a list of files and directories inside the recycle bin. This will help you iterate over them for further actions.

Delete Files:
Use fs.unlinkSync() to delete individual files. If you want to delete directories, you might need to use a recursive approach.

Handle Errors:
File operations can throw errors. Implement error handling to gracefully manage any issues that might arise during file deletion.

Test Safely:
Before implementing the deletion logic, test your program with operations that don't permanently delete files. For example, you can log the files you find in the recycle bin first.
